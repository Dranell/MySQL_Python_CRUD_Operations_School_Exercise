The purpose of this application is to build a database using the language of Python in unison with MySql for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD Operations) information for a school. The database will be comprised of four tables relating to clients for the school, actual courses the school provides, participants in the courses, and information for available teachers the school has. A relational database will be used to help structure and organize the different branches of information to be categorized and Python will be used for efficiency in building the database with all information.
